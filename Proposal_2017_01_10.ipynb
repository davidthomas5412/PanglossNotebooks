    "## Background\n",
    "\n",
    "Modern numerical simulations have given us a good understanding of dark matter structure for standard cosmological scenarios, while surveys have done the same for the distribution of galaxies. This has allowed us to develop a good picture of how mass and luminosity are distributed in the universe. However, there is still work to be done connecting these two distributions. [1]\n",
    "\n",
    "We are proposing to infer the relationship between dark matter halo mass and galaxy luminosity (mass-luminosity) from a strategically chosen field of view in the Millennium Simulation dataset. The field of view will be chosen such that it contains a high mass dark matter halo which we will use to callibrate our inference. The deliverable will be a 2D contour plot of galaxy luminosity vs dark matter halo mass. Special attention will be given to the luminosity scatter at the low-mass end of the spectrum, $10^{11}-10^{12}$ solar masses, which is less constrained. The resulting contour plot will help researchers further measure and constrain the mass-luminosity relation.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Catalog\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use a halo catalog from the Millenium Simulation, a 10 billion particle simulation with high resolution. The particles in the simulation have a mass of $8.6 \\times 10^{8}$/h solar masses which gives the data a resolution which will allow us to better study the mass-luminosity dark in the low mass region. [2] \n",
    "\n",
    "##### Dark Matter Halo Profiles\n",
    "\n",
    "It is typical to represent dark matter structure in a space by a collection of spherically symmetric density profiles. The canonical profile for Cold Dark Matter structure is the NFW profile [3]: \n",
    " \n",
    "$$\\rho_{NFW}(r) = \\frac{\\rho_0}{\\frac{r}{R_s}\\Big(1 + \\frac{r}{R_s}\\Big)^2}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where the scale radius $R_s$ and density $\\rho_0$ are halo dependent. However, the total mass of this profile diverges when integrated out to infinity. To resolve this issue, we use the BMO profile [4]:  \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\rho_{BMO}(r) = \\rho_{NFW}(r) \\cdot\\Big(\\frac{r_t^2}{r^2+r_t^2}\\Big)^2$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $r_t$ is the truncation radius that has been shown to be a better fit to simulated data. This choice also has computational benefits for our weak lensing model.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Weak Lensing Model\n",
    "\n",
    "#####  Cosmological Parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "We use the same cosmological parameters in our model that are used in the Millennium Simulation to maintain consistency: $\\Omega_M = 0.25, \\Omega_\\Lambda = 0.75, h = 0.73$.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Field of View\n",
    "\n",
    "The field of view is a 1600 arcmin$^2$ field, a wide enough field to use weak lensing effects to infer halo masses. The field will be centered at (right ascension = -0.021112 rad, declination = -0.024584 rad) in the 'GGL_los_8_0_0_0_0_N_4096_ang_4_Guo_galaxies_on_plane_27_to_63.images.txt' file which corresponds to the most massive halo ($2.126830 \\times 10^{14}$ solar masses).\n",

    "##### Luminosity Function\n",
    "\n",
    "The Schechter Function [5] is typically used to characterize galaxy luminosity functions and has the form \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\phi(L) = \\Big(\\frac{\\phi^*}{L^*}\\Big)\\Big(\\frac{L}{L^*}\\Big)^\\alpha e^{-(L/L^*)}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\phi(L)$ measures the number of galaxies per unit luminosity per unit volume. Typically the parameters $L^*, \\phi^*$, and $\\alpha$ are taken from observations across a selected wavelength band.\n",

    "##### Halo Mass Functions\n",

    "##### Mass-Luminosity Relation\n",
    "\n",
    "The mass-luminosity relation is calculated by setting the luminosity L of a galxy hosted in a halo of mass M to be connects mass and luminosity through the integrals\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\int_L^\\infty \\phi(L) dL = \\int^\\infty_M [n_h(M) + n_{sh}(M)]dM$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In [1] they found that the relation can be well fit by a double power law of the type:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$L = A \\frac{(m/m^\\prime)^b}{(c + (m/m^\\prime)^{dk})^{1/k}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "with the best fit parameters $A = 5.7 \\times 10^9, m^\\prime = 10^{11}, b = 4, c = 0.57, d = 3.72$, and $k=0.23$."
